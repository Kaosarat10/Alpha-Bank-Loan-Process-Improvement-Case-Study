#  Alpha Bank Loan Approval – As-Is Process Mapping

##  Overview
This repository documents the **current (as-is)** loan approval workflow for Alpha Bank. The purpose is to analyze existing inefficiencies and identify key pain points in preparation for designing an improved, digital-first process.

The as-is mapping was developed using:
- Stakeholder interviews (with a relationship manager in a Nigerian bank)
- Research on standard loan practices across Nigerian banks
- User reviews of digital lending platforms (e.g., Specta by Sterling Bank)

---

##  Objective
To map the actual loan approval process from start to finish, capturing all decision points, handoffs, and areas where customers or staff encounter delays, confusion, or friction.

---

##  Key Problems Identified
- Manual paper-based forms and physical document submission
- Repeated document checks at multiple stages
- Long turnaround time (1–2 weeks on average)
- No real-time loan status updates for customers
- Use of disconnected systems for credit, KYC, and AML checks
- Delays from multiple handovers between departments
- High dropout rate due to collateral/guarantor requirements
- Poor customer support experience on digital platforms
