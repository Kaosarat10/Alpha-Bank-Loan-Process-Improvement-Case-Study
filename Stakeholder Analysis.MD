##  Stakeholder Analysis

Today was all about **Stakeholder Analysis** which is understanding who is involved in the loan process at Alpha Bank, what they care about, and how much influence they have on the project.

Although I couldn't interview everyone, I had a deep conversation with a Customer Relationship Manager from a Nigerian bank, which gave me practical insight into the realities of the loan process. I combined this with desk research and industry knowledge to identify all relevant stakeholders and analyze their roles, interests, and impact.

This step is important because a successful digital loan system must work for everyone involved, from the customer filling the form to the manager tracking performance. Understanding their needs will guide the next phases of the project — especially requirements gathering and solution design.

**Attached is the Stakeholder Analysis document**, where you’ll find:
- A full list of stakeholders
- Their roles in the current loan process
- Their main interests and expectations
- Their level of influence and engagement strategy

This is one of the most important steps in business analysis — knowing who you’re designing for, and how to get them involved.
