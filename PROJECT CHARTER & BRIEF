# Alpha Bank Loan Process Improvement Case Study

## Project Description

This project is a business analysis case study focused on redesigning the loan approval process at Alpha Bank — a fictional regional bank modeled after the realities of many Nigerian banks. The goal is to identify the pain points in the current manual loan system and propose a digital solution that reduces delays, improves customer experience, and ensures regulatory compliance.

## Background

A common struggle for many Nigerian entrepreneurs is accessing bank loans. The process often feels overwhelming, repetitive, and unclear. People walk into banks with hopes of funding their dreams, only to be met with endless paperwork, unclear requirements, and no feedback.

The process typically involves:
- Long lists of required documents that are difficult to obtain
- Multiple paper forms to fill manually
- Verification processes that take weeks
- Several physical visits to the bank
- No communication during the entire process

As a result, many applicants drop off midway — not because they don’t qualify, but because the process itself is too frustrating.

This case study simulates that experience through Alpha Bank — a fictional bank whose current loan process is manual, slow, and lacking in transparency.

## Key Issues Identified

- The loan process is heavily paper-based and manual  
- Verification and approval take too long  
- Customers abandon the process due to frustration  
- Compliance checks cause delays  
- Communication with applicants is minimal or non-existent

## Project Goal

The objective is to analyze the current (as-is) loan process, identify bottlenecks, and propose a streamlined, digital (to-be) system that:

- Reduces processing time by at least 40%
- Improves loan completion rates
- Enhances customer experience
- Ensures KYC/AML compliance without delays
- Automates routine tasks
- Provides real-time updates to applicants
- Connects securely with external credit bureaus
