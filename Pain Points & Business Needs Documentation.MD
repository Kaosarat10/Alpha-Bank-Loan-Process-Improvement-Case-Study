# Alpha Bank Loan Process Improvement  
## Pain Points & Business Needs Documentation

---

## Project Overview

This section of the case study focuses on identifying pain points and translating them into actionable business needs for improving Alpha Bank's current loan approval process.

---

## What I Did

I worked on identifying the pain points — the specific delays, inefficiencies, and user frustrations within the existing loan process. These insights were derived from:

- The mapped As-Is process  
- Stakeholder interviews  
- User reviews from an existing digital loan platform

After identifying the pain points, I translated them into business needs — the high-level goals and system requirements the new solution must meet in order to address the problems effectively.

## Approach

To define the business needs, I followed this structured method:

- Pain Point: Understand what is going wrong in the current process  
- Cause: Determine why the issue is happening  
- Business Need: Propose a viable solution that addresses the root cause and improves process efficiency and user experience

This approach ensured that each proposed improvement directly responded to real issues and aligned with the Nigerian banking environment.
