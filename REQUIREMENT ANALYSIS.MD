# Day 4 â€“ Requirement Gathering

## Introduction  
This phase focused on gathering essential requirements for redesigning the loan approval process at Alpha Bank. The goal was to understand the current workflow, identify major pain points, and capture what users and internal teams expect from an improved digital loan system.

## Sources of Information  

To ensure the requirements reflect real-world conditions, I used three key sources:

### 1. Primary Interview  
A live, structured interview was conducted with **Eke Elise**, a **Business Relationship Manager at a Bank Nigeria**, who has over five years of experience in loan processing.  
Through this conversation, I gathered insights from three perspectives:
- **Loan Applicant** (customer view)  
- **Relationship Manager** (staff/user view)  
- **Credit/Compliance Analyst** (regulatory view)

### 2. Online Research on Nigerian Banks  
To validate and expand on the interview insights, I researched loan processing practices at major Nigerian banks, including:  
- **Access Bank**  
- **GTBank**  
- **Zenith Bank**

This helped in aligning proposed solutions with standard industry operations.

### 3. Specta Loan App â€“ User Feedback  
I reviewed public user reviews of the **Specta Loan App**, a digital loan platform by Sterling Bank.  
This gave visibility into the user-side experience of digital lending in Nigeria, including challenges such as:
- Poor app functionality  
- Repeated errors during loan requests  
- Frustration due to lack of support and transparency
