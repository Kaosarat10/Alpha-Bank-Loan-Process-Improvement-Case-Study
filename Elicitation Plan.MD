### Day 3 – Requirement Elicitation Plan

Today’s focus was on planning how to gather detailed requirements for the Alpha Bank loan process redesign.

I conducted a focused interview with a seasoned Relationship Manager at a Nigerian bank who shared deep insights from multiple perspectives — loan officer, credit analyst, and frontline staff engaging directly with loan applicants.

The goal was to understand the loan workflow, identify pain points, and uncover what features a new digital system must have to improve both customer and staff experience.
