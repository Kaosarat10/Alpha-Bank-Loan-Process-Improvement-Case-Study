# Alpha-Bank-Loan-Process-Improvement-Case-Study
This project is a business analysis case study focused on redesigning the loan approval process at Alpha Bank, a fictional regional bank modeled after the realities of many Nigerian banks. The goal is to identify the pain points in the current manual loan system and propose a digital solution that reduces delays, improves customer experience.
